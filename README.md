# LTX-MultiMotion：Number-free Person Motion Generation from Text
Built on LTX-Video-2B's lightweight architecture, this project re-engineers encoder and decoder to transform the spatial width dimension into a number-of-person-related representation. This enables dynamic motion generation for varying character counts without pre-defined constraints.
